@par Create project automatically:

To create project of each example automatically, double click the CreatProject.bat file in each example
folder.

@par Create project manually:

To create project of each example manually, copy the corresponding project template folder into the path
of example code. For example, copy "project_template/IP/Template/MDK_ARM/" into "example/GPIO/InputOutput/".

Files below also needs to copy from template folder into the path of example code. For example,
from "project_template/IP/Template/" into "example/GPIO/InputOutput/".
  - ht32fxxxx_conf.h
  - ht32fxxxx_usbdconf.h
  - system_ht32fxxxx.c

For the example code which has special project setting, Holtek provides separate project related files
(on the folder of the example). User do not need to copy any template files to these examples.

After the copy is finished, double click on Project File to load the IDE. Follow the instruction of IDE to
build, download, and debug the example code. Refer to the Quick Start guides below for more information.
